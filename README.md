# React Meme Generator

Scrimba React Course - Project 3

## Description

This is a meme generator built out in react as part of the [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).  The course material is also available via the freeCodeCamp YouTube page here: [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8).

## Background

While I initially started this course as a follow up to CodeCademy's [Learn React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101), I quickly became increasingly more involved with React through frontend development responsibilities.  After a break from the course I decided to return and complete the material to deepen my understanding of the React library and its usage.

Overall I find the lessons and their pacing to be enjoyable and highly recommend them to anyone just getting started with React.
